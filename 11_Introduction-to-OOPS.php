Introduction to OOPS
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. 

Object-oriented programming is a core of PHP Programming, which is used for designing a program using classes and objects that contain both data and functions. 

 
Advantages of OOPS
Programs are faster to execute.
Better code reusability. 
Easy to understand code structure. 
Very easy to partition the work in a project based on objects.
Easy to make fully reusable programs with less code and less development time. 
 
Disadvantages of OOPS
OOPS cannot be applied everywhere as it is not a universal language.
Need to have a good understanding of classes and objects to apply OOPS. 
It takes a lot of effort to create. 
It is slower than other programs.
OOPS programs are large in size when compared to normal programs.
